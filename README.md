# Web-Developing-Tacos

This is the repository where I put all of my HTML, CSS and JavaScript codes.

Since my school had no classes for this, these are all codes I made all for fun, for practice or for a programming club I ran in high school, the "Web and Tech Club".

You can view my sites in action at: https://codepen.io/Dev-In-Da-Den or see my websites stored in gists at: https://gist.github.com/Heartia
